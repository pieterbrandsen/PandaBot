Room planner
=============

To setup a room and build the base this part will be used.

A room has different parts that need to be build and checked:
- Defense
- Source structures
- Base
- Roads

The following parts will be included:
- Road builder
- Source structures
- Defense
- Base

Road builder
----------------

A road must be able to be build in the same room or to a external room.

A optimal path must be gathered using the road fatigue of a road.

Source structures
------------------

When needed the source structures are going to be placed.
Container next to the source (1range) and Link in 2 range of the source.

When the link is going to be build the container should be removed and removed from memory.

Defense
----------------

Optimal wall/rampart building to close the base from outsiders. When using a bunker the optimal placement differs from all other bases.

This is optimized based on the least amount of ramparts and closest to the base.

Base
----------------

Get optimal base type first using swamp/plain terrain.

Use the optimal base type and plan that type out when possible.
